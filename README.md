Zone-2: aerobic, low effort (long easy runs, recovery runs)
Zone-3: aerobic, medium effort (general aerobic training)

**Features:**
- One minute history of the heart-rate
- Colors indicating how well within bounds you are
- Targeted Zone is selectable (Zone-2, Zone-3 or even the Zone-4/Threshold)
- Additional Settings in Connect-IQ Phone app to customize the Data Field
- Option to enable alerts


**What is Zone 2 Training?**
- Zone 2 Training, or "low heart rate training", is a way to build up fitness, without being at a too strenuous pulse. It can be used as a great compliment to more intense training, and also in general for general fitness.

**Where do I customize the Data Field?**
- In the Connet-IQ App on your Mobile Device, navigate to Zone Training and click "Settings"

**How do I install/use this field?**
1. Install the Data Field from the Connect IQ app

3. Hold the button on the middle-left side until Settings open
